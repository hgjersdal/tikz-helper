tikz-helper

Uses common lisp to generate tikz code for simple 2D data representation. Graphs, histograms,
functions.

Also contains an implementation of the Levenberg-Martquart algorithm for fitting fuctions to
data, as well as cubic spline interpolation for srawing smooth lines between datapoints.

The file tikz-helper-example.lisp contains code that generates a few simple plots. The plots
can be viewed by compiling master.tex.
